# Java-RMI
Third project of the Advanced Programming course taken in Spring 2017

The goal of this project was to implement Remote Method Invocation in java. The client will invoke a method that resides on the server side.

To run the codes, first, you should run Server.java in the src/server directory and then run SampleClient.java in the src/client directory.
